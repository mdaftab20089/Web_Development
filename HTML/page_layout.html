        <article>
            Hi, I'm Md Aftab, a Computer Science undergraduate with a deep passion for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Full-Stack Web Development. Currently, I'm interning at Celebal Technologies, where I'm working on a Customer Lifetime Value Prediction project, applying data science to drive business insights.
With hands-on experience in building real-time applications like an Indian Sign Language Translator and a Drowsiness Detection System, I specialize in tools and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and YOLOv5. I also have a solid foundation in core CS subjects like Data Structures & Algorithms, DBMS, OS, and Computer Networks.

On the web development side, I'm skilled in React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, and enjoy creating user-friendly, scalable applications.

I thrive in environments where innovation meets impact and am always looking for opportunities to learn, build, and contribute to meaningful tech solutions.
