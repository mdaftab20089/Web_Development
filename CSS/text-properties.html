    <h1>Iron Man</h1>

        I'm afraid that that assertion is simply not supported by the numbers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ironman"> IronMan</a> (disambiguation) has almost no
        incoming links other than redirects; given that it is also an unlikely search term, it may be assumed that
        almost all its pageviews come from redirections. Given the roughly similar levels of pageviews to this page and
        to its target, I conclude that Ironman is the most important redirect funnelling into Iron Man (disambiguation),
        which also makes sense. It is self-evident that Iron Man is by far the most popular single destination of all
        possible permutations. The point is that, even given that this popular redirect has fed directly into Ironman
        Triathlon for several days of this month, it still does not achieve as many page hits even as the disambiguation
        page. Given the tremendous popularity of the superhero destinations compared to the Ironman Triathlon, I don't
        think that assertion has much evidence to support it. Remember, I'm not saying that Ironman should redirect to
        Iron Man or somesuch, let alone that Ironman Triathlon should be removed or hidden from Iron Man
        (disambiguation); only that, given there is no overwhelmingly popular target for incoming links to this page, it
        would be appropriate to direct them to the disambiguation page rather than attempt to second-guess where
        prospective readers might be headed.

        o take this argument a bit further, try typing Ironman (one word) into google. Out of the first 100 entries,
        only 2 refer to Iron Man (the comic character), one of which is our Wikipedia article, 24 refer to films (mostly
        the 2008 film), 59 refer to triathlon, and 15 refer to other subjects (including advertising for an ironing
        board!). These search results show both the one-word and two-word versions, but importantly, only 4 of the
        one-word version refer to anything other than triathlon. Bear in mind also that the film count is inflated by
        the recent release of the 2008 film, so the true triathlon count is higher.
